# Chopper

A simple wave slicer for E/S Daisy POD.

Default tempo is set to 120 BPM (2Hz). Tempo settings are:

- 120 BPM - LED 1 at 60% intensity
- 140 BPM - LED 1 at 100% intensity
- 80 BPM - LED 1 at 30% intensity

Using buttons 3 and 4 requires a [basic pod expander](https://github.com/KnightHill/daisy-basic-expander).
